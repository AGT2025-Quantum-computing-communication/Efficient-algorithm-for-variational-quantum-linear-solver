**Introduction**

In this notebook, we introduce a new variational quantum linear solver algorithm, with application to Poisson equation. This algorithm consists of employing the parallelism advantage that offers quantum computers to speedup the convergence to the target state( solution). Below is the detailed mathematics.

**Problem setup**

Let's assume that we want to solve a system of $N\times N$
